\title{A very short introduction to PDFLatex with mem}
\author{Holger Rapp}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

To compile this document, just run mem in the current directory. 

\section{Dependency tracking}
\label{sub:dependency_tracking}

Mem obviously gets it right if you change the Latex document. But is also gets
it right when you \verb|\include{}| or \verb|\input{}| another file. Let's
input the ultra short \verb|included_file.tex| in this directory: 

\texttt{\input{included_file.tex}}

Well, the layout is completely broken, but that's not the point here. We could
fix it with proper texing.  Go ahead; try changing \verb|included_file.tex|.

Mem also tracks dependencies for included graphics. But for nothing else at the
moment.

\section{One more thing} 
\label{sec:one_more_thing}

No tex document is complete without the Euler formula:

\begin{equation}
   e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
\end{equation}
